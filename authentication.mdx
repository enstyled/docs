Authenticate each request by providing your user encoded email and password in an Authorization header:

```
Authorization: Basic base64(email:password)
```

You can learn more about [Basic HTTP Authentication](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Authentication).

<Warning>Please keep your email and password secure! Change them if you think they are compromised.</Warning>

<Note>If your integration does not require administrator access, it's a good idea to create a separate user on your job board to authenticate the API requests.</Note>

<Tip>Admin users can read, create, update and delete any resource on the board. Some resources will return extra data when authenticated as administrator or the owner of that resource.</Tip>
