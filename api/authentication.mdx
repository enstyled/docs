You should provide your user email and password in an `Authorization` header in order to authenticate each request:

```
Authorization: Basic base64(email:password)
```

Admin users can read, create, update and delete any resource on the board. Some resources will return extra data when authenticated as administrator or the owner of that resource.

<Warning>Please keep your email and password secure! Change them if you think they are compromised.</Warning>

<Note>If your integration does not require administrator access, it's a good idea to create a separate user on your job board to authenticate the API requests.</Note>
